# Chef's Table: il pomodorino - rustic trattoria in Edinburgh #
il pomodorino is an Italian restaurant run by chefs Massimo Bottura and Fabio Vivani. The website is part of the restaurant´s digital marketing strategy, targeting local foodies and tourists in the Edinburgh area who are looking for a genuine experience of rustic Italian cuisine. The website helps visitors get familiar with the philosophy behind the food of the restaurant by introducing them to the chefs on the Home page. The two other pages show the menu, and a booking form through which visitors can book a table at the restaurant.

## Features ##


### Existing Features

__Header with Navigation Bar__

-	The header contains the restaurant logo and a navigation menu linking to each page on the website: Home, Menu and Book a table. The restaurant logo also has a link to the Home page.
-	The header is identical on all pages for good UX, however for small screens (mobile) the navbar aligns underneath the logo while maintaining the same styling and functionality.
-	The navbar ensures that the user can navigate and utilize the different pages of the website comfortably, as well as making it possible to keep e.g. the menu and booking pages in separate tabs. In doing this, the user doesn’t have to use the “back” button in case it wants to have another look at the menu or home page while in the middle of a booking.
-	The header and navbar are fully responsive to enable the user to navigate and explore the website comfortably without having to use the scrollbar.

 __The landing page image__

 -	The hero image stretching the width of the screen is present on all pages. The image gives the visitor an impression of the food served, connects to the restaurant name (pomodorino is small tomato in Italian) as well as gives the visitor a place to rest their eyes from reading text.
-	On all pages, the page main content is below the hero image, except for the confirmation.html page (redirected to when submitting the booking form). On this page, there is a text overlay on the hero image, containing the confirmation message. Below the hero image is the footer.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
