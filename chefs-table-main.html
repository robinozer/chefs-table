                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <br>
                <p>We southern Italians like to focus on simplicity in the food we prepare and serve. That means that we
                    also try to keep the servings simple. You may have noticed that Italians serve meals as a series of
                    piatti, or courses. Each course focuses on just one or two small servings of food. For example, we
                    will
                    serve an antipasto of crostini or salami, then clear the plates and serve a primo piatto which is
                    usually a pasta or rice dish. Before we serve the primo piatto (first course), we clear away the
                    antipasti. We do that so that we can focus on the flavors of the food in this new piatto.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Because we serve the food in multiple courses, that means that I often make the cooking process a
                    family
                    event. People come into the kitchen and eat the antipasto while I prepare the primo piatto.
                    Conversations in the kitchen become infused with the spirit of mutual cooperation and curiosity, and
                    by
                    the time we go to the table for the first course, we've often shared lots of laughter and
                    friendship. A
                    question about a recipe naturally engenders a conversation about cooking process, which leads to
                    lots of
                    other discussions.</p>
